Final Code Submission for vsHacks 2022.

Teams were required to create a project based around the theme of helping high school students. Thus, our group has created AIcademy, a web application that offers students the ability to upload their course curriculums and take an initial quiz on the uploaded material. The student is then shown their results, given specific feedback, and finally future study questions focusing on the areas that the student performed least well in in the initial diagnostic quiz. Future plans include the implementation of an AI model to give more specific feedback and better identify student weaknesses in order to help them study better.
